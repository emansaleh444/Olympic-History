# Olympic-History
The modern Olympic Games were from the beginning part of 
world culture and modern history, reflecting political tensions, 
economic crises, cultural flowering, and technological 
development.
From the very first edition athletics events had a privileged place 
in the Olympic program. Much have changed since 1896, not 
only in number of events, athletes, competition and prizes, but in 
philosophy, sport sciences, ethics and professional approach as 
well.
In this project we will work with a historical dataset on the 
modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 
1896 to Rio 2016
